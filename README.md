# Boot.dev Build Ai Agent in Python

This repository contains my solutions to backend programming puzzles from the Boot.dev course.

## Overview

The content here follows a guided curriculum. I’m not designing software from scratch — instead, I’m working through exercises meant to build core backend skills in a structured, hands-on way.

The focus is on:
- Solving logic-based coding challenges
- Understanding backend concepts through implementation
- Developing fluency with syntax and problem-solving patterns

## Learning Context

This is part of a self-paced backend development track. I treat it more like a technical notebook than a polished project — code may be puzzle-specific, experimental, or built to satisfy assessment criteria.

## Status

Actively working through modules. Content will grow as I progress through the course.

This repo isn’t meant to demonstrate project design — it's a record of learning-by-doing.
